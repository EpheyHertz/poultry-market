# Payment Amount Rounding System

## Overview

The payment system now includes automatic amount rounding functionality to handle decimal amounts from IntaSend payments. This ensures consistent processing of payment amounts by rounding up any decimal values to the next whole number.

## Rounding Logic

### Function: `roundUpPaymentAmount(amount: number): number`

This function implements ceiling rounding for payment amounts:

```typescript
// Examples:
roundUpPaymentAmount(12.36) // Returns: 13
roundUpPaymentAmount(12.00) // Returns: 12
roundUpPaymentAmount(12.01) // Returns: 13
roundUpPaymentAmount(100.99) // Returns: 101
```

### Implementation

The rounding is applied in several key places:

1. **Payment Status Summary** (`getPaymentSummary`)
   - Raw amount from IntaSend is rounded up
   - Both raw and rounded amounts are included in response
   - Validation uses rounded amount

2. **Payment Verification** (`/api/payments/intasend/verify`)
   - Received amounts are rounded up before validation
   - Comparison uses rounded values
   - Error messages show both raw and rounded amounts

3. **Amount Validation** (`validatePaymentAmount`)
   - Tolerance increased to 1 KES to accommodate rounding
   - Validates against both exact and rounded expected amounts
   - Returns appropriate messages for rounding scenarios

## Usage Examples

### API Response Structure

```typescript
// Payment Status Response
{
  "amount": 13,        // Rounded amount
  "rawAmount": 12.36,  // Original amount from IntaSend
  "currency": "KES",
  "isAmountValid": true,
  "amountValidation": {
    "isValid": true,
    "expectedAmount": 13,
    "receivedAmount": 13,
    "message": "Payment amount verified successfully (rounded up from 12.78 to 13)"
  }
}
```

### Validation Logic

```typescript
// Original order: 1000 KES
// With fees: 1032 KES
// IntaSend returns: 1032.36 KES
// System processes: 1033 KES (rounded up)
// Validation: âœ… Passes (within tolerance)
```

## Configuration

### Tolerance Settings

- **Default tolerance**: 1.0 KES (increased from 0.05 KES)
- **Reason**: Accommodates rounding differences
- **Configurable**: Can be adjusted in `validatePaymentAmount` function

### Rounding Method

- **Method**: Ceiling (Math.ceil)
- **Direction**: Always rounds UP
- **Precision**: To whole numbers (no decimals)

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All payment amounts are whole numbers
2. **User-Friendly**: Eliminates confusing decimal amounts
3. **Error Reduction**: Reduces amount mismatch errors
4. **Flexibility**: Handles IntaSend's decimal responses gracefully

## Integration Points

### Frontend Display
- Shows rounded amounts to users
- Maintains raw amounts for debugging
- Clear messaging about rounding

### Database Storage
- Stores both raw and processed amounts
- Maintains audit trail of rounding decisions
- Enables analysis of rounding patterns

### Error Handling
- Detailed error messages include rounding information
- Helps troubleshoot amount mismatches
- Provides transparency to users

## Testing

Use the test script to verify rounding functionality:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-amount-rounding.ts
```

This tests various scenarios including:
- Basic rounding operations
- Payment validation with rounded amounts
- Edge cases and boundary conditions

## Migration Notes

- **Backward Compatible**: Existing payments continue to work
- **Gradual Rollout**: Only new payments use rounding
- **Monitoring**: Track rounding frequency and patterns
- **Rollback**: Can disable by modifying rounding function

## Monitoring

Track these metrics:
- Frequency of amount rounding
- Average rounding amounts
- Validation success rates
- User feedback on rounded amounts

This system ensures robust handling of decimal payment amounts while maintaining accuracy and user clarity.
